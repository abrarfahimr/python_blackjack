# Python Black Jack Game
This is a game the user plays with the computer to win a single round of black jack. 

## Description
The game is run on the terminal. To help users who do not know how to play here are some rules:
- The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer’s hand without going over 21. Before cards are dealt, players place their bets (Total 100 chips in this game).
- Each player starts with two cards that are face up. Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11; whichever makes a better hand.
- One of the dealer’s two cards is face down until the very end after every player completes his hand.
- You can ask for another card (hit) or stick with your current hand (stand). You have the option to keep hitting until you’re satisfied with your hand, or you go over 21 (bust).
- If you bust, the dealer wins regardless of the dealer’s eventual hand. The dealer must hit until her cards total 17 or higher.
